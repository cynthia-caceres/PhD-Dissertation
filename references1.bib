The management interviews, which were mostly in personnel, industrial engineering, and operations areas of manufacturing companies, were supplemented by data on the disadvantaged provided by civil rights, poverty, and manpower agencies. The report utilizes the framework established in the study to show that the internal market does not imply inefficiency and may represent an improvement in dealing with structural unemployment. (BH)

The `lasso' minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

The determinants and effects of the informal sector are studied in an endogenous growth model whose production technology depends essentially on congestable public services. The model concludes that changes, both in policy parameters and the quality of government institutions, that promote an increase in the relative size of the informal economy will also generate a reduction in the rate of economic growth. The paper then uses data from Latin American countries in the early 1990s to test some of the implications of the model and to provide estimates for the size of the informal sector throughout these countries. The empirical approach consists of identifying the size of the informal sector to a latent variable for which multiple causes and multiple indicators exist. The size of the informal sector is found to depend positively on proxies for tax burden and labor-market restrictions, and negatively on a proxy for the quality of government institutions. Furthermore, the empirical results suggest that an increase in the size of the informal sector negatively affects growth by, first, reducing the availability of public services for everyone in the economy, and, second, increasing the number of activities that use some of the existing public service less efficiently or not at all.},

The procedure provides a visually clear representation of where in the density of wages these various factors exert the greatest impact. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we find, as in previous research, that de-unionization and supply and demand shocks were important factors in explaining the rise in wage inequality from 1979 to 1988. We find also compelling visual and quantitative evidence that the decline in the real value of the minimum wage explains a substantial proportion of this increase in wage inequality, particularly for women. We conclude that labor market institutions are as important as supply and demand considerations in explaining changes in the U.S. distribution of wages from 1979 to 1988.},

A Survey of the Global Evidence of their Size and of their Impact from 1970 to 1995*) Using various methods (currency demand, physical input (electricity) measure, model approach), which are discussed and criticized, estimates about the size of 67 developing, transition and OECD countries are presented. The average size of the shadow economy (in % of GDP) over 1989-93 in developing countries is 39.2%, in transition countries 23.2% and in OECD countries 14.2%. An increasing burden of taxation and social security contributions combined with rising state regulatory activities are the driving forces for the size of the shadow economy. According to some findings, a growing shadow economy has a negative impact on official GDP growth, however, a positive impact of corruption on the size of the shadow economy can be found, i.e. the bigger the corruption, the larger is the shadow economy.

The presence of congestion associated with the enforcement of property rights implies that informality can be useful. Whether bureaucratic rent-seeking is detrimental to growth then depends on how good a substitute informality is to production in the formal sector. In order to create profits which can be appropriated, rent-seeking bureaucrats limit entry into the formal economy. As a result, firms operate in the informal sector even when the cost of informality is high, in which case lower growth emerges. However, when the cost of informality is low, a large number of firms choose to operate informally irrespective of entry conditions. In the latter case, growth is unaffected by a rent-seeking bureaucracy as entry restrictions in the formal economy do not bind. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates.},

This work has potentially serious implications for workers' well-being: wage and salary work without a contract. In what follows, I refer to this form of employment as "wage and salary work in the informal sector" in the sense that it is undeclared to appropriate government authorities and, consequently, unregulated and untaxed. The article is organized as follows: Section II describes the sample and provides some characteristics of household head employment in wage and salary jobs in the informal sector in Chile at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The conceptual framework and methodology used to examine the determinants of household head employment in wage and salary jobs in the informal versus the formal sector and the welfare implications of lacking a work contract are presented in Section III. Section IV contains a discussion of the findings, and Section V concludes the study. © 2004 by The University of Chicago. All rights reserved.},

small urban and small rural enterprises. Furthermore, minimum wages
raise wages in these informal sectors more than in larger firms and

In this work we derive a necessary condition for the lasso variable selection to be consistent. Consequently, there exist certain scenarios where the lasso is inconsistent for variable selection. We then propose a new version of the lasso, called the adaptive lasso, where adaptive weights are used for penalising different coefficients in the ℓ1 penalty. We show that the adaptive lasso enjoys the oracle properties; namely, it performs as well us if the true underlying model were given in advance. Similar to the lasso, the adaptive lasso is shown to be near-minimax optimal. Furthermore, the adaptive lasso can be solved by the same efficient algorithm for solving the lasso. We also discuss the extension of the adaptive lasso in generalized linear models and show that the oracle properties still hold under mild regularity conditions. As a byproduct of our theory, the nonnegalive garotte is shown to be consistent for variable selection. © 2006 American Statistical Association.},

   abstract = {Ecuador engaged in drastic economic reforms in the early 1990s. In the
decade that followed there is a tale of great economic and political
turmoil. In the process, the country's dependence on primary exports
(oil, shrimps and bananas) has not been reduced, while the economy is
likely to have become even more sensitive to terms-of-trade shocks
following its decision to adopt the dollar as official means of payments
thereby fully giving up independence of monetary policy. The early 1990s
began with fairly successful economic stabilization helped by debt
reduction under the Brady deal, use of the exchange rate as nominal
anchor and a rise in trade and capital inflows following import
liberalization and capital account opening. In the first half of the
1990s, modest growth was achieved and real wages were up fostering a
substantial decline in (urban) poverty. Things start to breakdown after
1995 following political turmoil and several external shocks. A
full-blown currency and financial crises emerged in 1999 as the domestic
currency could no longer be defended. A shift towards a flexible
exchange-rate regime and rise in interest rates did not evade, but
rather accelerated the banking crisis as it revealed the currency
mismatch and large share of bad debts in the system. Per capita income
fell by 9 per cent in 1 year and poverty increased substantially during
1998-9. The crisis eventually led to the decision to dollarize the
economy. Inflation hit at an unprecedented height in the first months
following dollarization, but the inflation rate has gradually
decelerated since and the economy has slowly recovered. Inflation has
been higher though than that of the major trading partners leading to an
appreciation of the hypothetical real exchange rate. Real wages have
been able to recover alongside the real appreciation alike in the early
1990s. Workers remittances have become a major new source of household
income following massive emigration after the economic crisis of 1999.
These factors have helped reduce (urban) poverty in 2001-2. Factors
associated with the structural reforms, however, seem to have pushed up
income inequality. This trend has been visible throughout the 1990s,
particularly due to a rise in skill-intensity of production in most
traded and non-traded goods sectors pushing up the wage gap between
skilled and unskilled workers. Employment growth has been as volatile as
aggregate output growth, but on balance more workers have been pushed in
the informal sector and a widening gap between formal and informal
sector workers has further contributed to rising inequality. These
trends may be associated to a large extent with the process of trade
liberalization in Ecuador as shown by the CGE simulations. The
simulation results indicate that the trade opening in Ecuador induced
mild aggregate welfare gains, but rising income inequality due to rising
wage differentials between skilled and unskilled workers implies that at
the end of the day trade liberalization had no poverty-reducing impact.
Scenarios of deepened trade integration, such as under the Free Trade
Agreement for the Americas and a WTO scenario of free trade and no
export subsidies only exacerbate these trends. Under the WTO scenario
rising inequality and unfavourable relative prices for agricultural
exports would even lead to a rise in poverty. To reap the benefits of
trade, Ecuador's stabilization and growth strategy should thus give
priority to investment in human and physical infrastructure to foster
productivity growth and reduce the shortage of skilled workers.},

   abstract = {This paper analyses part of the controversy over export processing zones
(EPZs)-the labour market and gender impacts-using unique time-series
labour force survey data from an African setting: urban Madagascar, in
which the EPZ (or Zone Franche) grew very rapidly during the 1990s.
Employment in the Zone Franche exhibits some basic patterns seen
elsewhere in export processing industries of the developing world, such
as the predominance of young, semi-skilled female workers. Taking
advantage of microdata availability, we estimate earnings regressions to
assess sector and gender wage premia. Zone Franche employment is found
to represent a significant step-up in pay for women who would otherwise
be found in poorly remunerated informal sector work. As it provides
relatively high wage opportunities for those with relatively low levels
of schooling, export processing development may also eventually have
significant impacts on poverty. Further, by disproportionately drawing
women from the low-wage informal sector (where the gender pay gap is
very large) to the relatively well-paid export processing jobs (where
pay is not only higher but also similar for men and women with similar
qualifications), the EPZ has the potential to contribute to improved
overall gender equity in earnings in the urban economy. Along many
non-wage dimensions, jobs in the EPZ are comparable to or even superior
to other parts of the formal sector. However, the sector is also marked
by very long working hours and high turnover, which may work to prevent
it from being a source of long-term employment and economic advancement
for women.},

   abstract = {The degree to which a labor market is segmented and jobs in the formal sector of the economy are rationed is critical to the analysis of coverage of social insurance and pensions. In Chile, using unique panel data spanning the 1998-1999 contraction, I find little evidence that self-employment is the residual sector of a dualistic labor market, as is often depicted in the literature. Data on transitions between sectors show that self-employment is not a free-entry sector, and that entrepreneurs can be "pushed" out of self-employment just as others are pushed out of formal employment during economic downturns. However, employment without a contract does exhibit many of the features of the free-entry, employment safety net depicted in the dualistic literature. An annex to this paper, presents supportive evidence from static analysis of selection-corrected wage differentials, and a comment on the drawbacks of this approach. * The sections reviewing the literature on labor markets in developing countries, motivates the analysis of earnings differentials presented in the Appendix.

   abstract = {Most Latin American countries adopted the welfare state as a model, though developing it in very different ways and, often, imperfectly because of structural differences between them and the industrialized countries. Social protection coverage is still patchy, with many informal-sector workers not covered and widespread public feelings of insecurity. The author examines the complicated structural and labour situation and the latest ideas in Latin America and the European Union to strengthen social cohesion. He analyses approaches to incorporating the informal sector into the modern sector, addressing social exclusion, combining flexibility for employers with security for workers, and achieving near-universal social protection. ocial cohesion is an attribute of countries which have successfully achieved S economic progress and redistributed the fruits of that growth to the whole of society. Thus, social cohesion helps ensure fairer development and involve all the population in efforts to achieve that growth, each according to his/her skills. The welfare state laid down the bases of postwar economic expansion in a social system that included all social classes and provided levels of security and stability enabling a systemic approach to the problems of vulnerable groups. Integration and security were achieved through full employment, the protection of the labour force and solidarity throughout the whole social system. The welfare state model served as a guide for the policies adopted by most countries in Latin America, though it was implemented to varying degrees, and often imperfectly, given the structural differences distinguishing these countries from developed countries. Social protection is still limited and the needs of non-wage earning groups are inadequately provided for (Tokman, 2006, pp. 10-17).},

We revisit this issue by using an integrated data set which contains information on all these aspects. Building on a simple analytical framework, we test the channels affecting the degree of informality. We find that the quality of the legal framework is crucially important in determining the size of the informal sector, whereas the significance of taxes, regulations, and financial constraints is reduced in the context of a well functioning legal system, consistent with the presented model. Additionally, firm size is negatively correlated with the propensity to go informal; finance constraints tend to induce informality among smaller firms but not among large firms, whereas legal obstacles induce informality among larger firms. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {In developing countries, informal firms (those that are not registered with the government) account for about half of all economic activity.  We consider three broad views of the role of such firms in economic development.  According to the romantic view, these firms would become the engine of economic growth if not stopped by government regulation.  According to the parasite view, informal firms, by avoiding taxes and regulations, unfairly compete with the more efficient formal firms and, by taking away their market share, undermine economic progress.  According to the dual view, informal firms are highly inefficient, do not pose much threat to the formal firms, but also do not contribute to economic growth, which is driven by the efficient formal firms.

Using data from World Bank firm level surveys, we find that informal firms are small and extremely unproductive, compared even to the small formal firms, and especially relative to the larger formal firms.  Compared to the informal firms, formal ones are run by much better educated managers.  As a consequence, they use more capital, have different customers, market their products, and use more external finance.  Hardly any formal firms had ever operated informally.  This evidence is inconsistent with the romantic and parasite views, but supports the dual view.  In this "Walmart" theory of economic development, growth comes from the creation of the highly productive formal firms.  Informal firms keep millions of people alive, but disappear over time.},

and earnings in urban West Africa
Using a series of comparable labor force surveys in urban West Africa,
we estimate the private returns to education among representative
samples of workers in seven economic capitals (Abidjan, Bamako, Cotonou,
Dakar, Lome, Niamey and Ouagadougou). The data allow us to provide a
unique cross-country comparison using rigorously the same variables and
methodology for each country. We tackle the issues of endogenous sector
allocation (public, formal private and informal sectors) and endogeneity
of the education variable in the earnings functions. We find that the
returns to schooling are most often enhanced once an endogenous
education variable is accounted for. This effect holds particularly true
in the informal sector. In most West African cities of our sample, the
public sector gives more value to education, followed by the formal
private sector and then the informal sector. We also shed light on
convex returns to education in all the cities and sectors, including in
informal activity. More generally, a major contribution of this paper is
to provide evidence of significant effects of education on individual
earnings in the informal sectors of the West African cities, even at
high levels of schooling. Journal of Comparative Economics 37 (3) (2009)

   abstract = {We consider estimation of panel data models with sample selection when the equation of interest contains endogenous explanatory variables as well as unobserved heterogeneity. Assuming that appropriate instruments are available, we propose several tests for selection bias and two estimation procedures that correct for selection in the presence of endogenous regressors. The tests are based on the fixed effects two-stage least squares estimator, thereby permitting arbitrary correlation between unobserved heterogeneity and explanatory variables. The first correction procedure is parametric and is valid under the assumption that the errors in the selection equation are normally distributed. The second procedure estimates the model parameters semiparametrically using series estimators. In the proposed testing and correction procedures, the error terms may be heterogeneously distributed and serially dependent in both selection and primary equations. Because these methods allow for a rather flexible structure of the error variance and do not impose any nonstandard assumptions on the conditional distributions of explanatory variables, they provide a useful alternative to the existing approaches presented in the literature. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Rich panel datasets for Brazil, Mexico, and South Africa are assembled to define informality in a comparable way and to control for (time-invariant) unobserved heterogeneity. Estimations are conducted at different points of the conditional earnings distributions. Interesting results emerge. First, informal salary workers are systematically underpaid compared to their formal sector counterparts, in all countries and at almost all conditional quantiles. Yet penalties are very moderate in Brazil and Mexico while more substantial in South Africa, a country where legal advantages in formal employment are effective. Second, informal self-employment contributes to a more dispersed earnings distribution in all three countries. International comparisons reveal a continuum of situations reflecting historical and legal differences across countries, from very large self-employment penalties in South Africa to significant conditional earnings premia in Mexico. © 2011 The Authors.

capital, by conceptualising knowledge in a comprehensive and
multidimensional way. In our empirical approach, knowledge encompasses
several formal and informal skills, to complement the mainstream view
narrowly concerned with education and on-the-job training. Our results
for Italy point out that despite much rhetoric about the reduction (or
even the reversal) of gender gaps in education, women often lack the
main skills and competencies that can profitably be deployed in the
labour market. Unsurprisingly, in Italy women's accumulation of labour
market experience is mostly hindered by unpaid housework burdens.
However, when adopting an extensive definition of knowledge these
activities may be regarded as a source of relevant knowledge. Yet, they
do not seem to be positively valued by the market, either in terms of
employability or in terms of wages, thus calling for a serious
rethinking of the role of knowledge in shaping men's and women's
economic opportunities.},

   abstract = {This paper addresses the questions as to the size and causes of earnings
differentials in two urban African labor markets, those of Ghana and
Tanzania. We have panel data so we can ask how far time invariant
unobservables, market ability for short, matters in the determination of
earnings. We also have information on whether the individual is own
self-employed, self-employed with employees, a private or public sector
wage employee and the size of the enterprise in which wage employees
work or which the self-employed owns. We find, mirroring work on
developed economies, that unobserved individual market ability is by far
the most important factor explaining the variance of earnings. With
controls for such ability the gap between private wage employment and
civil servants is about 50%. With controls for enterprise size we find
that wage employees earn the same as the self-employed in both Ghana and
Tanzania. Enterprise size matters. At most half of the OLS effect of
size on earnings can be explained by unobservable ability. Workers in
the largest firms are the high earners with wage rates which exceed
those of civil servants. These results all assume exogenous movement. We
find evidence that endogeneity bias may be serious and may be
understating the extent of both the size effect and the private sector
wage (negative) premium. The implications of our results for
understanding the nature of formal and informal employment in Africa are
discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

For some workers the informal sector is an attractive employment opportunity, whereas for others-rationed out of the formal sector-the informal sector is a strategy of last resort.

Our results apply even when $p$ is much larger than the sample size, $n$. We show that the IV estimator based on using Lasso or Post-Lasso in the first stage is root-n consistent and asymptotically normal when the first-stage is approximately sparse; i.e. when the conditional expectation of the endogenous variables given the instruments can be well-approximated by a relatively small set of variables whose identities may be unknown. We also show the estimator is semi-parametrically efficient when the structural error is homoscedastic. Notably our results allow for imperfect model selection, and do not rely upon the unrealistic "beta-min" conditions that are widely used to establish validity of inference following model selection. In simulation experiments, the Lasso-based IV estimator with a data-driven penalty performs well compared to recently advocated many-instrument-robust procedures. In an empirical example dealing with the effect of judicial eminent domain decisions on economic outcomes, the Lasso-based IV estimator outperforms an intuitive benchmark. In developing the IV results, we establish a series of new results for Lasso and Post-Lasso estimators of nonparametric conditional expectation functions which are of independent theoretical and practical interest. We construct a modification of Lasso designed to deal with non-Gaussian, heteroscedastic disturbances which uses a data-weighted $\ell_1$-penalty function. Using moderate deviation theory for self-normalized sums, we provide convergence rates for the resulting Lasso and Post-Lasso estimators that are as sharp as the corresponding rates in the homoscedastic Gaussian case under the condition that $\log p = o(n^\{1/3\})$.},

The wage curve is an empirical regularity describing a negative relationship between regional unemployment rates and individuals' real wages. While this relationship has been well documented for a number of countries including Turkey, less attention has focused on how this relationship differs for informal versus formal employment. This is of utmost importance for less developed countries where informal employment plays a significant role in the economy. Using the Turkish Household Labour Force Survey observed over 26 NUTS 2 regions, we find that real hourly wages of informal workers in Turkey are more sensitive to variations in regional unemployment rates than wages of formal workers.

   abstract = {This paper offers a descriptive analysis of the way in which the working
world of contract labourers in a public-sector Indian steel plant is
differentiated from that of its regular workforce. The two kinds of
workers regard themselves as distinct kinds of people and are now best
seen as distinct social classes. While the sociology of India has
broadly accepted the manual/non-manual labour distinction as the crucial
marker of the boundary between the working and the middle classes, what
is suggested here is that that between naukri (secure employment) and
kam (insecure wage labour) - which cuts right across that distinction
and is broadly congruent with that between formal- and informal-sector
employment - is a more important marker of difference. At work, the two
kinds of workforce are sharply distinguished by the material rewards of
their jobs and by their security and conditions of employment; outside
it by differences in life-style and attitudes - a gap that has grown
with the liberalization of the Indian economy. The composition of the
work groups to which the two kinds of labour characteristically belong
are sharply differentiated by gender, by regional ethnicity and by urban
or rural residence. Interactions within the work group are again very
different, while interactions between regular and contract workers are
largely confined to the work itself. Outside it they are kept to a
minimum, testifying to a shared sense that socially the two kinds of
workforce are profoundly different.},

   abstract = {In developing countries, informal firms account for up to half of economic activity. They provide livelihood for billions of people. Yet their role in economic development remains controversial with some viewing informality as pent-up potential and others viewing informality as a parasitic organizational form that hinders economic growth. In this paper, we assess these perspectives. We argue that the evidence is most consistent with dual models, in which informality arises out of poverty and the informal and formal sectors are very different. It seems that informal firms have low productivity and produce low- quality products; and, consequently, they do not pose a threat to the formal firms. Economic growth comes from the formal sector, that is, from firms run by educated entrepreneurs and exhibiting much higher levels of productivity. The expansion of the formal sector leads to the decline of the informal sector in relative and eventually absolute terms. A few informal firms convert to formality, but more generally they disappear because they cannot compete with the much more-productive formal firms.},

Based on a new definition of informal employment, we estimated the proportion of informal employment relative to total non-agricultural employment in urban China and found it to be 49.7% in 2005 and 40.3% in 2010. Meanwhile, our study illustrated that informal employees' earnings were 67% that of formal employees, and this large earnings gap raised the Gini coefficient to 0.42 in 2005. The Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition result shows that the earnings gap explains more than half of the overall personal income inequality in urban China. These results indicate that informal employment has a significant effect on the income distribution in urban China. Consequently, regulating the labour market, eliminating job discriminations and legislating the informal employment should be considered as alternative means of reducing inequality in China.},

We control for observables in a nonlinear way using propensity score reweighting and carefully check for potential measurement errors. Using similar definitions of informality, we obtain consistent results for all three countries: informally employed workers earn much less than formal workers primarily because of lower observable and unobservable skills. Estimates of the conditional wage gap show that they are also underpaid compared to their formal sector counterparts. In all three countries, the informal wage penalty is larger in the lower part of the conditional distribution and tends to disappear at the top (i.e., the informal sector increases wage dispersion). The magnitudes of these effects vary across countries, with the largest penalties in lower conditional quantiles of South Africa and more modest wage gaps in Latin America.

   abstract = {We propose robust methods for inference about the effect of a treatment variable on a scalar outcome in the presence of very many regressors in a model with possibly non-Gaussian and heteroscedastic disturbances. We allow for the number of regressors to be largerthan the sample size. To make informative inference feasible, we require the model to be approximately sparse; that is, we require that the effect of confounding factors can be controlled for up to a small approximation error by including a relatively small number ofvariables whose identities are unknown. The latter condition makes it possible to estimate the treatment effect by selecting approximately the right set of regressors. We develop a novel estimation and uniformly valid inference method for the treatment effect in this setting, called the "post-double-selection" method. The main attractive feature of our method is that it allows for imperfect selection of the controls and provides confidence intervals that are valid uniformly across a large class of models. In contrast, standard post-model selection estimators fail to provide uniform inference even in simple cases witha small, fixed number of controls. Thus, our method resolves the problem of uniform inference after model selection for a large, interesting class of models. We also present a generalization of our method to a fully heterogeneous model with a binary treatment variable. We illustrate the use of the developed methods with numerical simulations and an application that considers the effect of abortion on crime rates. © The Author 2013.

While most of the papers on this topic are drawn from (emerging) Latin American, Asian or some African countries, Madagascar represents an interesting case. So far, very few studies in general, even less so in Sub-Saharan Africa, used panel data to provide evidence of the informal sector heterogeneity. Taking advantage of the 1-2-3 Surveys in Madagascar, a four-wave panel dataset (2000–04), we assess the magnitude of various formal/informal sector earnings gaps. Is there an informal sector job earnings penalty? Do some informal sector jobs provide pecuniary premiums and which ones? Do possible gaps vary along the earnings distribution? Ignoring distributional issues is indeed a strong limitation, given the compound question of how informality affects earnings inequality. We address heterogeneity issues at three different levels: the worker, the employment status (wage employment vs. self-employment) and the earnings distribution. Standard earnings equations are estimated at the mean and at various conditional quantiles of the earnings distribution. The results suggest that the sign and magnitude of the formal–informal sector earnings gaps highly depend on the workers’ employment status and on their relative position in the earnings distribution. In the case of a poor and fragile country like Madagascar, these findings provide new and robust empirical backups for the existence of a mix between the traditional exclusion vs. exit hypotheses of the informal sector.},

   abstract = {This study investigates the formal/informal employment earnings gap in Turkey. We focus on the earnings differentials that can be explained by observable characteristics and unobservable time-invariant individual heterogeneity. We first, estimate the standard Mincer earnings equations using ordinary least squares (OLS), controlling for individual, household, and job characteristics. Next we use, panel data and the quantile regression (QR) techniques in order to account for unobserved factors which might affect the earnings and the intrinsic heterogeneity within formal and informal sectors. OLS results confirm the existence of an informal sector penalty almost half of which is explained by observable variables. We find that formal-salaried workers are paid significantly higher than their informal counterparts and of the self-employed confirming the heterogeneity within the informal employment. QR results show that pay differentials are not uniform along the earnings distribution. In contrast to the mainstream literature which views informal selfemployment as the upper-tier and wage-employment as the lower-tier, we find that self-employment corresponds to the lower-tier in the Turkish labor market. Finally, fixed effects estimation indicates that unobserved individual characteristics combined with controls for observable characteristics explain the pay differentials between formal and informal employment entirely in the total and the female sample. However, informal sector penalty persists in the male sample.},

The aim of this study was to determine if there is a relationship between informal employment and health among different groups of workers in Chile. We used a cross-sectional study with data for 8357 workers from the first Chilean work, employment, health and quality of life survey (2009–2010). Workers were classified as formal or informal according to the contractual situation and workplace for dependent workers, educational level for the self-employed, and number of employees for employers. We then grouped these into Dependent formal, Non-dependent formal, Dependent informal and Non-dependent informal. Sex-stratified descriptive analyses and Poisson regression models with prevalence ratios (PR) adjusted for age were used to quantify the association between these four groups of employment and self-rated health and mental health (GHQ12). There was a positive and statistically significant association between informal employment and poor self-rated and mental health for men but not for women. Models for the interaction between informal employment and sex illustrated that it was statistically significant for both health outcomes. This study found a consistent relationship between informal employment and poor self-rated health and mental health. Further research is needed to better understand this association and the gender differences observed in this study.},

Methods: I examine determinants of informal-sector participation in five waves of data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study using probit, pooled Tobit, and fixed-effects OLS models. Results: Approximately 53 percent of urban fathers and 32 percent of urban mothers with young children pursue informal work over a nine-year period. Informal work most often occurs in conjunction with regular work. Workers who work in both sectors in the same year are more likely to be nonminority race, higher education (mothers only), own credit cards, and work in skilled white- or blue-collar occupations. Workers who ever participate in only the informal sector are more likely to be younger, to have health limitations, and to have never worked in the regular sector. Informal participation spells are shorter than regular-sector participation spells and are associated with changes in regular-sector participation and occupation but not most other life events. Conclusion: Consistent with past work, informal work among parents of young children is widespread across socioeconomic groups. Transitions in and out of the informal sector are strongly related to changes in regular-sector employment and occupation. The results suggest that regular-sector participation provides access to informal work opportunities.},

impacts on individual's life especially in developing countries where
opportunities are limited, job informality rates are high, and
socioeconomic characteristics gaps are big. The aim of this paper is to
explore the relationship between job informality and accessibility to
employment by public transport in Sao Paulo Metropolitan Region (SPMR),
Brazil. To do so, we calculate a cumulative-opportunity measure of
accessibility to jobs for 633 areas within the SPMR. We use a multilevel
mixed-effects logistic regression model to estimate the effect of job
accessibility on the likelihood of being informally employed,
controlling for individual and other area characteristics. To account
for informal sector heterogeneity, two regression models are generated:
one for the workers earning below minimum wage and one for the workers
earning above minimum wage. The results show that accessibility to jobs
is unevenly distributed across the region, largely concentrated in the
core of the region, and especially in the high-income areas. The
regression results show that for workers earning less than the minimum
wage, a higher level of accessibility to jobs by public transport is
associated with a lower likelihood of being a worker in the informal job
sector. For informal workers earning more than the minimum wage, car
ownership seem to be more relevant than transit accessibility in
determining the likelihood of being part of the informal job sector. In
light of these findings, increasing accessibility by public transport
through either expanding transit services to areas with high informality
rates to have a better access to formal jobs or supporting the
decentralization of formal jobs may be a way to achieve reductions in
informality rates, especially among those earning less than the minimum
wage.},

When workers are rationed out of the formal segment of the labor market against their will, i.e., the labor market is segmented, their quality of life is limited, and their wellbeing is reduced. When they can freely choose between a formal or informal employment relationship, i.e., the labor market is integrated, their wellbeing can reach high levels even in the presence of informal employment. We, therefore, test whether the Ukrainian labor market is segmented along the formal-informal divide, slicing the data by gender and age. The analysis that we perform consist in the analysis of short-term and medium-term transitions between five employment states, unemployment and inactivity. We also analyze wage gaps of mean hourly earnings and across the entire hourly earnings distribution, controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. According to our results segmentation is present for dependent employees: for a large part of informal employees informal employment is used as a waiting stage to enter formal salaried employment and is not voluntarily chosen. As far as self-employment is concerned the evidence is mixed regarding segmentation in the Ukrainian labor market. This heterogeneity in outcomes implies that not all informal work is associated with a low quality of life and reduced wellbeing in post-transition economies.},

In the first place, using a Mincer earnings function shows there is a

divide. However, human capital theory applies to formal employees rather
than to informal ones. Hence, labor market segmentation is not reducible
to earnings functions. In the second place, a multinomial logit model

characteristics of individuals: age, gender, marital status, and human
capital. Finally, the paper explores from a longitudinal perspective a
cohort of 445 individuals both surveyed in 2007 and 2012. The
aforementioned determinants explain the patterns of occupational
mobility of active individuals who experience a change that improves or
deteriorates their job position, while shifting in both directions

More concretely, in finite samples with Gaussian errors and asymptotically in the case where the Lasso estimator is tuned to perform conservative model selection, we derive exact formulas for computing the minimal coverage probability over the entire parameter space for a large class of shapes for the confidence sets, thus enabling the construction of valid confidence regions based on the Lasso estimator in these settings. The choice of shape for the confidence sets and comparison with the confidence ellipse based on the least-squares estimator is also discussed. Moreover, in the case where the Lasso estimator is tuned to enable consistent model selection, we give a simple confidence region with minimal coverage probability converging to one.

   abstract = {Background: South Africa suffers from an unusually high unemployment
rate - officially averaging 25% since 1999Q3. In addition, depending on
whether one uses the official or broad definitions of unemployment,
since 2008 there are on average between 2 and 3.3 times as many
unemployed people as there are people in the informal sector. Hence the
question: why do the unemployed not enter the informal sector to create
a livelihood?
Aim: To fill this gap we propose a macro-economic framework that
incorporates both formal (primary) and informal (secondary) sectors, as
well as involuntary unemployment resulting from entry barriers to the
labour market. We believe such a model provides a more suitable basis
for macroeconomic policy analysis.
Setting: Standard macroeconomic theories at best provide a partial
explanation for the South African unemployment problem, focusing mostly
on the formal sector.
Methods: The article uses a theoretical analysis.
Results: The article presents a macro-economic framework that
incorporates both formal (primary) and informal (secondary) sectors, as
well as involuntary unemployment resulting from entry barriers to the
labour market.
Conclusion: If the assumptions on which the model draws hold in the
South African reality, then a solution to the unem-ployment problem
involve policies addressing product and labour market structures and
behaviour in the primary sector, as well as policies addressing the
numerous barriers to entry, such as borrowing constraints, that
poten-tial entrants into the secondary sector face.},

wages in the formal and informal sectors moved in parallel (with a 15%
premium in the formal labor market). During the crisis, however, formal
wages did not adjust down while wages in the unregulated informal labor
market fell so that by 2013 the gap had grown to 32%. The difference
was particularly salient for workers in occupations where the minimum
wage is likely to be binding, and in simple occupations where there is
high substitutability between immigrant and native workers. Calibrating
a simple partial equilibrium model of spillovers between formal and
informal markets, we find that less than 10% of workers who lost a
formal job during the crisis move to the informal sector. We also find
that if the formal sector wages were fully flexible, the decline in
formal employment would be in the range of 1.54.5%umuch lower than 16%

consistently increased in most labour market segments in India. This
paper focuses on how informalisation, migration, segmentation, and
social discrimination, which operate most significantly at the lower end

labour market inequality. There is a large and growing wage gap between
formal and informal workers in the organised sector after controlling
for other characteristics of the workers. On average, workers who are
allocated formal or informal work in the organised sector have very
similar characteristics. Across both formal and informal work, while
education and experience improves wages, female and low-social-status
workers have lower wages, controlling for other characteristics. This
paper argues that seasonal and circular labour migrants form a growing
segment of the informally employed. Poor and low-caste workers form a
disproportionate proportion of such workers. Seasonal/circular migrant
workers usually form the lowest rung of labour at organised sector work
sites. They are segmented and fragmented by the recruitment process and
along lines of caste, sex, ethnicity, language and region. This
segmentation and fragmentation creates the basis for capital to acquire
low-cost, highly flexible labour, who work long hours and take up the
most dangerous work. This paper shows that the process of labour
segmentation in Indian labour markets builds on well-entrenched
processes of social discrimination but has assumed new forms as the
workforce has become more mobile and informalised. Gender-based labour
segmentation builds on the culturally determined social reproduction
responsibilities of female workers and other socio-cultural factors.
This paper concludes that while the above processes are linked to the
underlying dynamics of capitalist growth in India, more equitable labour
market outcomes at the bottom of the pyramid can be achieved through the
provision of suitable social protection, sensible labour market
regulation and a more comprehensive anti-discrimination framework.},

   abstract = {We ask how labor regulation and informality affect macroeconomic volatility and the propagation of shocks in emerging economies. For this, we propose a small open economy business cycle model with frictional labor markets, endogenous labor participation, and an informal sector. Our own calculations from the ENOE national household survey reveal that these three margins are important to account for the labor market dynamics in Mexico. The model is calibrated to the Mexican economy, in particular to business cycle moments for employment and informality. We show that interest rate shocks, which affect specifically job creation in the formal sector, are key to obtain a countercyclical informality rate. In our model, the presence of an informal sector might help to mitigate the impact of a stringent labor regulation on employment and consumption fluctuations. In that sense, it adds flexibility to the economy in its adjustment to shocks, but at the cost of a lower productivity and an excess TFP and output volatility. Reducing the burden of labor regulation to the formal sector might achieve the goal of reducing output volatility while improving at the same time the efficiency in the allocation of resources.},

sectors for an economy that cares about redistribution and illustrates
its relationship with the enforcement level. The technology gap and
labour rigidity explicate the duality. The state can tax the formal
sector to subsidise informal income and finance public infrastructure.
Alternatively, enforcement, which is costly and corresponds to a variety
of discrete components from the security of property rights and
integrity of contracts to control of corruptions, can be chosen to
favour the formal sector and discourage the informal sector. It is
observed that weaker enforcement required to accommodate some degree of
informality, which releases tax burden from the formal sector needed for
redistribution, can accelerate growth rate. However, sufficiently weaker
enforcement dampens the formal sector expansion and growth rate. The
growth rate registers an inverted-U shaped relationship against the
enforcement level. The optimum enforcement can, however, be higher
without formal labour union and subsidisation. This must be higher for
welfare maximisation than that of growth rate, especially when the
consumer cares about the quality of enforcement.},

the public sector generally pays a wage premium. However, in most
countries the wage premium disappears when the public sector is compared
to only formal sector private employees, although there is heterogeneity
across skill levels. Premiums tend to be lowest for high skilled public
sector employees, who in several countries pay a penalty for working in
the public sector. On the other hand, the public sector premium tends to
be higher for employees with less education, those working in lower paid
occupations, and those working in low skilled occupations. This pattern
is consistent with wage compression in the public sector. Across
countries, the wage premium is only weakly associated with countries'
level of development. These findings challenge the existing consensus
that public sector workers tend to enjoy a significant wage premium over
their private sector counterparts and that this premium is especially
large in low income countries. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {We study long-term care (LTC) choices by families with mixedor
same-gender siblings. LTC can be provided either informally by children,
or formally at home or in an institution. A social norm implies that
daughters suffer a psychological cost when they provide less informal
care than the average woman. Daughters have a lower wage than sons so
that their opportunity cost of providing LTC is smaller. Families
maximize a weighted sum of children's and parent's utilities.
Because of the norm cost and the gender wage gap daughters will be the
sole provider of informal LTC in mixed-siblings families. Sons provide
LTC only if they have no female sibling.
We show that the laissez-faire (LF) and the utilitarian first best (FB)
differ for two reasons. First, because informal care imposes a negative
externality on daughters via the social norm. Second, because the
weights children and parents have in the family bargaining problem
differ in general from their weights in social welfare. While these two
problems are intertwined it appears that, unless children have a much
larger weight than parents, too much informal care will be provided,
especially by daughters, and that formal care should be subsidized.
Previous papers suggest that LTC policies should ``tolerate'', as a
side effect, some crowding out of informal care and that the latter
should be encouraged. Our results suggest instead that, because of the
existing social norm about gender roles in the family, optimal policies
should ``discourage'' informal care through subsidies on formal LTC.

in economies. In developing countries, the private sector is divided
into formal and informal private sectors. Little research has addressed
the changes in wage and labor among the public, formal private and
informal private sectors over time within a single framework. We study
the wage gap, labor mobility and the impact of changing employment
sectors on wages by using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition and
difference-in-difference (DID) methods with the Egyptian Labor Market
Panel Survey data from 1998 to 2012. The decomposition shows that the
wage gap between the public and formal (informal) private sectors has
remained strong, with education, age and working experience being the
driving forces. The DID method shows that the percentages and wage
losses of movers from the formal private sector to the informal private
sector are much higher and more significant than the percentages and
wage losses of movers from the public sector to the informal private
sector. In summary, Egyptian private sector employees face a high risk
of unwillingly falling into and staying in the informal private sector,
while the highly educated employees are only attracted to and stay long
term in the public sector. These results demonstrate likely obstacles
for further economic growth and the stability of the Egyptian economy
and have implications for other developing and Arab countries with a
sizeable public sector. The government may need to restructure wage

Our main finding is that increasing manufacturing import competition implied a significant rise in labor informality in more exposed local markets, especially among young and unskilled workers. These groups also suffered significant relative wage losses. Meanwhile, locations that benefited most from the increased demand for primary products experienced a relative increase in employment, particularly among young individuals, and reallocation from self-employment towards salaried jobs in the formal sector, along with relative wage gains among old-age workers.

The study emphasizes two things: first, identifying the existence of the absolute wage gap between formal and informal workers and, second, finding the intensity of discrimination in wage between formal and informal workers. The vast body of literature available on this issue identifies gender, caste, religion, and region as the factors causing wage discrimination. This literature makes a shift from these traditional concepts by explaining the importance of job contract as a basis of wage discrimination. This study utilizes the percentage relative gap (PGR) to work out the absolute wage gap between the two types of workers (formal and informal) and thereafter decomposes it to arrive at the source of the wage gap. The study applies the threefold Blinder–Oaxaca (B–O) decomposition method, which categorizes the total wage gap into three parts. The dependent variable chosen for the equation is the natural logarithm of daily wage. While the wage gap between formal and informal workers did not significantly fall during the study period, the results, on the other hand, indicate that the component of discrimination is larger than the component of endowment. This explains the discrimination perpetrated against informal workers in the Indian labor market. Tackling such discrimination necessitates implementation of more proactive policies for achieving wage equality in India.},

informal businesses exhibit rates of entry and exit around 14-18%
annually. Entry and exit rates are similar and highly correlated at a
point in time, within industries, and within regions. They both decline
over time and across space with economic development. Second, although
market selection influences which firms survive, entry and exit have
little net effect on aggregate (revenue) productivity or hiring of
workers outside the household. This owes to overlapping labor
productivity of entering and exiting firms and low subsequent
productivity growth and hiring among the surviving entrants.
Nonetheless, entry and exit are associated with large changes in
individual income. Third, the large overlap in revenue of entering and
exiting informal businesses and the high correlation between entry and
exit rates are related to the education of owners and their economic
activities before and after operating an informal business. Informal
business owners are less educated on average than wage workers in the
formal sector, but more educated than agricultural workers. The
transitions in and out of operating an informal business reflect the
underlying structure of economic activities of the working-age
population, with education gaps also playing a role. The most common
transition into non-farm businesses is to and from self-employment in
agriculture. The likelihood of this transition declines with economic
development, highlighting the role of net entry from agriculture into
informal non-farm businesses in structural change.},

incidental parameter bias. Over the whole period, informal wage
penalties are relatively small and do not suggest heavily segmented
labor markets, even at low wage levels. Yet, in the past decade, a
substantial negative selection into informal employment and
self-employment has taken place, on average and especially at low

contributed to the shakeout of less productive workers in the formal
sector, making the low-tier informal sector more of a last resort.},

   abstract = {Economic crises and instability during the COVID pandemic have led to a
significant additional workload and uncertainty for women. The COVID
virus has spread extremely rapidly, and mobility and migration are
severely limited, at least in the short term. The virus has a
significant impact on the health of people from those considered to be
migrants and refugees and their access to the labor market. According to
Eurostat, 1.4 million people who previously resided in an EU Member
State migrated to another Member State, and almost half of this
population are women. Migrating women are particularly exposed to a
number of specific consequences of the pandemic. Migrant women are
disproportionately the first to be laid off and the last to be rehired.
This is due to gender discrimination and precarious working conditions,
such as low wages, the greater burden of care work, and alternative
employment costs, especially given the gender wage gap and the
difficulty of accessing the formal economy. This study examines the
challenges many migrant women experienced in accessing the Eurozone
labor market during the COVID pandemic. Based on this primary objective,
the theoretical perspective of this research relies on the segmented
labor market theory. Within the framework of documentary research, this
work has chosen the path of descriptive analysis to achieve the study's
objectives. The findings presented in an intersectional framework
suggest that the impact on migrant women workers during the COVID
pandemic is exacerbated by a segmented labor market rooted in a
capitalist context and by gendered structures of racism in the European
labor market. In a capitalist context, migrant women would be
over-represented in the informal economy due to segmented labor market
policies and the effects of gendered racism. As a result, they would be
at the forefront of redundancies during the pandemic because of their
difficulty accessing the European labor market.},

the European Union (EU), there is still limited knowledge regarding the
exact functioning of this illegal employment scheme. To fill this gap,
we report data from the 2019 Special Eurobarometer on undeclared work,
which reveals that 30.1% of European workers have higher income from
employment than reported to tax authorities. Explicitly, 2.6% of
registered dependent employees are entitled to cash top-ups to the
official wage, for 7.8% of them the amount of supplementary payments
depends on the work efforts, whereas 9.2% receive informal remuneration
under multiple arrangements. In addition to these `regular recipients',
we also found that 10.5% of employees in the EU can be classified as
`sporadic quasi-formal workers'. Besides showing that wage
underreporting is far more pervasive than previously assumed, the study
also offers a more nuanced insight into different manifestations of this
illicit practice in the EU. Results of a two-level random intercept
multinomial logit model reveal that women are less likely to receive
fixed and variable cash-in-hand payments, whereas older individuals have
a lower propensity to receive work-time-related income. The analysis
also highlights that professionals, service sector employees, manual job
workers and individuals whose jobs require travelling are more prone to
variable wages compared to the rest of the population. Given a modest
success in combating the phenomenon to this date, these findings will be
particularly valuable for policymakers in their endeavours to devise
tailored policy measures. JEL Codes: E26, H26},

uncover whether (i) agglomeration economies in dense areas of Brazil

   abstract = {Purpose Despite a widespread assertion that wages are lower in the
informal than formal economy, there have been few empirical evaluations
of whether this is the case and even fewer studies of the gender
variations in wage rates in the formal and informal economies.
Consequently, whether there are wage benefits to formal employment for
men and women is unknown. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the wage
differential between formal and informal employment for men and women.
Design/methodology/approach To evaluate the wage differential between
the formal and informal economy for men and women, data are reported
from a 2017 survey involving 8,533 household interviews conducted in
Kosovo. Findings Using decomposition analysis and after controlling for
other determinants of wage differentials, the finding is that the net
hourly earnings of men in formal employment are 26% higher than men in
informal employment and 14% higher for women in formal employment
compared with women in informal employment. Practical implications Given
the size of the wage differential, the costs for employers will need to
significantly increase in terms of the penalties and risks of detection
if informal employment is to be prevented, along with more formal
employment opportunities using active labour market policies for
vulnerable groups, perhaps targeted at men (who constitute 82.8% of
those in informal employment). Originality/value This is one of the
first studies to evaluate the differentials in wage rates in the formal
and economy from a gender perspective.},

   abstract = {Labor market dualism has caused a persistent wage gap between formal and
informal workers in Indonesia. This study aimed to decompose the wage
difference between formal and informal workers based on cohorts in
Indonesia and further analyze the factors that influence this gap. This
allowed us to identify the structure of the labor market and whether it
tends to be segmented or competitive. By controlling the cohort, the
estimation result was compatible with the human capital accumulation
argument. The data sourced from the 2010 and 2019 National Labor Surveys
comprised 581,312 and 503,313 workers, respectively. This study used the
threefold Heckman selection-biased corrected Blinder-Oaxaca
decomposition technique. The results showed that the wage gap between
formal and informal workers is decreasing, especially among the younger
cohort. Among this cohort, the labor market is still segmented, although
the degree of segmentation is lower. In contrast, the older cohort labor
market is more competitive but at a decreasing rate. A further
decomposition showed that education has affected the wage gap between
young and old cohorts. However, this effect is diminishing. In addition,
differences in institutional labor market settings such as the wage
system and occupational health and safety systems have increased the
wage gap. The findings imply that equitable access to education for the
younger cohort and the improvement of labor market institutions can
reduce the gap between formal and informal wages.},

estimate earnings gaps across urban/rural, farming/non-farming and
gender divides at various earnings quantiles. Gaps in pre-fiscal formal
labor market earnings and informal non-market home production are
assessed, distinguishing the roles of workers' endowments differentials

to be pervasive, with rural and some female-headed households receiving
lower returns on their human capital in part because they lack
employment opportunities. Rural Russian households face mobility
barriers and lack decent employment opportunities, thus lacking
incentives for skill investment. Rural households tend to be less
educated and face low returns on their various marketable
characteristics. Gender gaps were particularly high historically,
particularly among lower quantile groups, but have been steadily falling

effects on employment and wages. Based on data from the National
Occupation and Employment Survey, differences-in-differences and event
study design models are estimated to calculate the average and dynamic
effects of the policy. The results show that the increase in the minimum
wage did not statistically affect the probability of participating in
the labor market or of being employed; however, among salaried workers,
it did increase the probability of working in the formal sector by 1.38
percentage points, where this effect rises to 2.34 percentage points
among women and was non -significant among men. Concerning the mean
hourly wage, an increase of 3.27% was observed in formal salaried
workers and of 3.56% among women, while no significant effects were
found within informal salaried workers and men. Along the wage
distribution, positive average effects were observed for formal wage
earners up to the 50th quantile and among informal wage earners up to
the 25th quantile. The increase in the minimum wage affected positively
and to a greater extent women and low-wage workers. Moreover, since the
wage increase was accompanied by other economic policies that appear to
have reduced inflation, the results can be interpreted as an upper bound
of the positive effects of the minimum wage in crease and in the absence
of the other policies, or contexts where only the wage in-crease

   abstract = {We study the causal impact of export growth on Chilean local economic development by exploiting spatial and time variations in local exposure arising from past differences in industry specialization across local labor markets and the evolution of tariffs and exports across industries. We find that growing exports implied a significant reduction in labor informality and labor income gains in more exposed local markets, driven by job creation and wage growth in the formal sector. These effects concentrate on senior skilled workers. Exposed locations also exhibit a relative decline in monetary poverty.},

   abstract = {In Mexico, approximately 55% of the working population is employed informally, contributing 24.4% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2022. This study analyzed the impact of wages, taxes, government spending, and unemployment on the informal economy of Mexico from 1980 to 2022, as well as its relationship with the tertiary sector’s contribution to the GDP. The methodology of the study was structural equation modeling. The findings of this study revealed that an increase in taxes, the unemployment rate, and the minimum wage in Mexico tends to be accompanied by a rise in informal employment. Finally, a unitary change in the latent variable informality affected the growth of the tertiary sector’s contribution to the GDP by 0.37 units.},

   abstract = {PurposeThis study aims at estimating the gender wage gap in Ecuador, and
its evolution over the last decade and a half, exploring its
heterogeneity through different working conditions (formal/informal,
full employment/underemployment, short term/long term and tenure/no
tenure) and workers personal characteristics (education level; age and
children).Design/methodology/approachPropensity score matching (PSM) and
coarsened exact matching (CEM) are used to examine the gender pay
inequality of wage earners in Ecuador, using the National Employment,
Unemployment and Underemployment Survey (ENEMDU) data set from 2007 to
2022.FindingsResults show a persistent gender pay gap, evidencing a
significant heterogeneity through the different dimensions taken into
account, in terms of working conditions and workers personal
characteristics. The evolution of the pay gap during the years analyzed
hardly shows any reduction of differences in earnings between men and
women; on the contrary, women exposure to precarious and unregulated
jobs seems to be increasing wage inequality.Practical implicationsThe
results make the case for active policies oriented not only at
containing the negative effects of the traditional division of labor
within the family but also at improving labor law enforcement,
mitigating informality and workers rapid turnover.Originality/valueThis
study is one of the few that use matching techniques to study the gender
wage gap and the first in Ecuador; the time span taken into account is
larger than previous studies, allowing a medium-long run perspective
across different economic phases.},

   abstract = {Due to the lower capacity of formal learning institutions, informal
learning is the prominent source of learning to skill a larger
population in India. Still, many skilled workers in India face the
problem of lower wages and difficulty finding employment opportunities
because of skill certification. The present study examines the impact of
skill certification on monthly wages using augmented Mincer wage
equations. Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition is employed to study wage
differentials between certified and uncertified skill workers. The
empirical findings suggest that workers' characteristics such as skill
certification, extended training period, superior occupational status,
permanent job tenure, higher education level, membership in trade
unions, and job experience help them earn higher monthly wages. The wage
gap between certified and uncertified skill production workers is also
observed based on skill certification. In addition, the wage gap is
reduced by characteristics such as the long duration of the training,
membership in trade unions, and job experience. However, uncertified
skill workers face wage discrimination with rising age. In India, it is
crucial to reduce wage differential due to skill certification to
improve competitiveness, efficiency, and productivity in the labor
market. Therefore, the government should promote skill development and
certification of skills acquired through informal learning to achieve
developmental goals.},

   abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to examine the emerging dynamics of
formal and informal employment in the context of Maharashtra. Using the
unit-level records from the recently published Employment and
Unemployment Surveys (EUS) of the National Sample Survey Organisation
(NSSO) in 2011-12 and various rounds of Periodical Labour Force Surveys
(PLFSs), we examine the nature and patterns of formal and informal
employment. Also, we investigate the role of personal, household, and
labour market characteristics in shaping the dichotomy between formal
and informal employment in Maharashtra. The findings of the paper
suggest that the wage gap between formal and informal employment is
greatly influenced by individual and employment characteristics such as
gender, marital status, years of schooling, technical education,
vocational training, work experience, and industry of work. In addition,
the paper also finds evidence for the marginalisation of women from the
labour market, the enormous size of women in unpaid domestic duties, the
lack of adequate coverage of formal employment in the rural sector, wage
disparity, and the burgeoning size of informal employment. From a policy
perspective, the paper suggests fostering inclusive economic growth by
facilitating greater participation of women in the labour market and
increasing the coverage of formal employment, which is crucial for
attaining a decent living standard.},

   abstract = {This article examines the intertwining relationship between informality
and education-occupation mismatch (EOM) and the consequent impact on the
workers' wages. In particular, we discuss two issues - first, the
relative importance of informality and EOM in determining wages; and
second, the relevance of EOM for formal and informal workers. The
analysis reveals that although both informality and EOM are significant
determinants of wages, the former is more crucial for a developing
country like India. Further, we find that EOM is one of the crucial
determinants of wages for formal workers, but it is not critical for
informal workers. The study highlights the need for considering the
bifurcation of formal-informal workers to understand the complete
dynamics of EOM especially for developing countries where informality is
predominant.},
